The goal here was to model the probability that a business goes bankrupt from different features. 
This was a classification project, since the variable to predict is binary (bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy).
Workflow in short :
- Data Analysis and drawing up important inferences.
- Implementation of various EDA techniques to clean the data and visualized it using different graphs.
- Prediction had to be done using 'Logistic Regression' as the output required is categorical. 
- Applied different classifiers and created various models in search of bestfit model.
- Finalized the model and deployed it for prediction.
- Model Deployment using Streamlit API and Streamlit Cloud.
